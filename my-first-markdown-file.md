#Hello Markdown

It is **so** nice to write code in this simple format.

Once you get the hang ot *it* you just:

*Remember the basic syntax
*Write your Doc!
*Done!

Now you can be a wiz at this language and write down stuff like 'console.writeline("Hello MarkDown!");'

Cant remember the language?
No problem. Just visit one of these resources:
